// We need to mock the electron app.getPath because this script runs in node context
// In a real scenario, this would be a utility called from main.ts or similar.
// Since we can't easily run this standalone without electron, I'll create a function
// that can be called from main.ts on startup, OR assuming the user wants me to add it
// via the app flow.

// Actually, the easiest way is to add a temporary logic in `main.ts` or `DatabaseManager` itself
// to seed if empty, OR expose an IPC.

// Let's create a "Utilities" class or function in `electron/demoSeeder.ts` that we can invoke.
