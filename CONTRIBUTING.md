## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue tracker as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- Specify your OS version.
- Specify your Node/Npm versions.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Natively users.

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- Follow the TypeScript and React styleguides.
- Document new code based on the Documentation Styleguide.
- End all files with a newline.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+ recommended)
- Git
- Rust (required for native audio capture compilation)

### Local Development

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/natively-cluely-ai-assistant.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up your `.env` file (refer to the README for template).
5. Start the development server: `npm start`

If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
Ensure the test suite passes.

### Architecture Overview

Natively uses a modern stack consisting of:

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend/Desktop**: Electron
- **Native Audio**: Rust (`napi-rs` for zero-copy ABI transfers)
- **Database**: SQLite (local storage with `sqlite-vec` for RAG)

When contributing, ensure you understand which context (Main Process, Renderer Process, or Native/Rust addon) your code will run in, and use the IPC correctly for communication.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
