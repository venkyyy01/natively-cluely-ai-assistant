<div align="center">

> **Natively** is a **free, privacy-first AI Copilot** for **Google Meet, Zoom, and Teams**. It serves as an open-source alternative to Cluely, providing **real-time transcription**, **interview assistance**, and **automated meeting notes** completely locally.

Unlike cloud-only tools, Natively uses **Local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** to remember past conversations, giving you instant answers during **technical interviews**, **sales calls**, and **daily standups**.

---

## Why Natively?

</div>

While other tools focus on being "lightweight" wrappers, Natively is a complete intelligence system.

- **Local Vector Database (RAG):** We embed your meetings locally so you can ask, "What did John say about the API last week?"
- **Rich Dashboard:** A full UI to manage, search, and export your history—not just a floating window.
- **Rolling Context:** We don't just transcribe; we maintain a "memory window" of the conversation for smarter answers.

## FAQ

#### Is Natively really free?
Yes. Natively is an open-source project. You only pay for what you use by bringing your own API keys (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), or use it **100% free** by connecting to a local Ollama instance.

#### Does Natively work with Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet?
Yes. Natively uses a Rust-based system audio capture that works universally across any desktop application, including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Slack, and Discord.

#### Is my data safe?
Natively is built on **Privacy-by-Design**. All transcripts, vector embeddings (Local RAG), and keys are stored locally on your machine. We have no backend and collect zero telemetry.

#### Can I use it for technical interviews?
Natively is a powerful assistant for any professional situation. However, users are responsible for complying with their company policies and interview guidelines.

#### How do I use local models?
Simply install **Ollama**, run a model (e.g., `ollama run llama3`), and Natively will automatically detect it. Enable "Ollama" in the AI Providers settings to switch to offline mode.
