> Natively is a **free, open-source, privacy-first AI assistant** designed to help you **in real time during meetings, interviews, presentations, and conversations**.


Unlike traditional AI tools that work *after* the conversation, Natively works **while the conversation is happening**. It runs as an **invisible, always-on-top desktop overlay**, listens when you want it to, sees what’s on your screen, and delivers **instant, context-aware assistance**.

Natively is fully transparent, customizable, and gives you complete control over **local vs cloud AI**, your data, and your credentials.

## Demo

![Natively Demo](demo.gif)

This demo shows **a complete live meeting scenario**:
- Real-time transcription as the meeting happens  
- Rolling context awareness across multiple speakers  
- Screenshot analysis of shared slides  
- Instant generation of what to say next  
- Follow-up questions and concise responses  
- All happening live, without recording or post-processing

## What Is Natively?

**Natively** is a **desktop AI assistant for live situations**:
- Meetings
- Interviews
- Presentations
- Classes
- Professional conversations

It provides:
- Live answers
- Rolling conversational context
- Screenshot and document understanding
- Real-time speech-to-text
- Instant suggestions for what to say next

All while remaining **invisible, fast, and privacy-first**.

---

## Key Capabilities

- Live answers during meetings and interviews
- Rolling context memory (understands what was just said)
- Screenshot and screen content analysis
- Real-time transcription
- Context-aware replies and follow-ups
- Global keyboard shortcuts across all applications
- Local AI support for offline and private use

> **Note:** Real-time transcription requires a Google Speech-to-Text service account. This is a hard dependency.

---

## Privacy & Security (Core Design Principle)

- 100% open source (AGPL-3.0)
- Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)
- Local AI option (Ollama)
- All data stored locally
- No telemetry
- No tracking
- No hidden uploads

You explicitly control:
- What runs locally
- What uses cloud AI
- Which providers are enabled

---

## Installation (Developers & Contributors)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+ recommended)
- Git
- Rust (required for native audio capture)

### AI Credentials & Speech Providers

**Natively is 100% free to use with your own keys.**  
Connect **any** speech provider and **any** LLM. No subscriptions, no markups, no hidden fees. All keys are stored locally.

### Supported Speech Providers
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** (Service Account)
- **Groq** (API Key)
- **OpenAI Whisper** (API Key)
- **Deepgram** (API Key)
- **ElevenLabs** (API Key)
- **Azure Speech Services** (API Key + Region)
- **IBM Watson** (API Key + Region)

### Supported LLM Providers
- **Google Gemini**
- **OpenAI**
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **Groq**
- **Ollama (Local)**
- **Custom OpenAI-compatible Endpoints**

> **Note:** You only need ONE speech provider to get started. We recommend **Groq** or **Deepgram** for the fastest real-time performance.  

---
#### Bring Your Own Google Speech-to-Text (Required)

**Important:**  
Natively relies on **Google Speech-to-Text** for real-time transcription.  
Without a valid Google Service Account, transcription will not function.

Your credentials:
- Never leave your machine
- Are not logged, proxied, or stored remotely
- Are used only locally by the app

### What You Need
- Google Cloud account
- Billing enabled
- Speech-to-Text API enabled
- Service Account JSON key

### Setup Summary
1. Create or select a Google Cloud project  
2. Enable Speech-to-Text API  
3. Create a Service Account  
4. Assign role: `roles/speech.client`  
5. Generate and download a JSON key  
6. Point Natively to the JSON file in settings
