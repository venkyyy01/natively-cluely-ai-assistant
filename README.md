## 🚀 Quick Start Guide
**For Personal Use:**
Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/evinjohnn/natively-cluely-ai-assistant/releases)

### Prerequisites (For Development)
- **Node.js**: Installed on your computer (v20+ recommended)
- **Git**: Installed on your computer
- **Rust**: Required for building the native audio capture module

- **AI Credentials**:
  - **Gemini API Key**: Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
  - **Google Service Account**: Required for real-time speech-to-text accuracy.
### Bring Your Own Google Speech-to-Text (BYOK)

**CRITICAL: Google Service Account is REQUIRED for transcription.**
Natively relies on Google Speech-to-Text for real-time transcription. Without a valid Google Service Account, the application's core transcription features will NOT function.

You must provide your own Google Cloud Service Account JSON key.
**Your credentials never leave your machine and are used only locally.** We do not proxy, log, upload, or store your keys — ever.

#### Why BYOK?
- You control billing & quotas
- No shared keys, no rate limits
- No hidden usage or tracking
- Works offline (except for Google STT calls)

#### What You Need
- A Google Cloud account
- Billing enabled
- A Service Account with Speech-to-Text access
- A JSON key file

#### Create a Google STT Service Account

**1. Create / Select a Google Cloud Project**
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a new project or select an existing one
- Enable billing

**2. Enable Speech-to-Text API**
- Go to **APIs & Services** -> **Library**
- Search for and enable **Cloud Speech-to-Text API**

**3. Create a Service Account**
- Go to **IAM & Admin** -> **Service Accounts** -> **Create Service Account**
- Name: `natively-stt` (or similar)
- Description: Optional

**4. Assign Permission**
- Add this specific role: **Speech-to-Text User** (`roles/speech.client`)
- *Do NOT use Owner or Editor roles unless testing*

**5. Create a JSON Key**
- Open the newly created service account
- Go to **Keys** -> **Add Key** -> **Create new key**
- Choose **JSON**
- Download the file and save it safely.
- **Action**: Set the Service Account location in the Natively settings to this file.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/evinjohnn/natively-cluely-ai-assistant.git
cd natively-cluely-ai-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# Note: This automatically builds the Rust native audio module
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root folder
   
   **For Gemini (Cloud AI) & Speech-to-Text:**
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/absolute/path/to/your-service-account.json
   ```
   
   **For Ollama (Local/Private AI):**
   ```env
   USE_OLLAMA=true
   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2
   OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
   ```
   
   - Save the file

### Running the App

#### Method 1: Development Mode (Recommended for first run)
1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This command automatically:
- Starts the Vite dev server on port 5180
- Waits for the server to be ready
- Launches the Electron app

#### Method 2: Production Build
```bash
npm run dist
```
The built app will be in the `release` folder.

## 🤖 AI Provider Options

### Ollama (Recommended for Privacy)
**Pros:**
- 100% private - data never leaves your computer
- No API costs
- Works offline
- Supports many models: `llama3.2`, `codellama`, `mistral`, etc.

**Setup:**
1. Install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. Set environment variables as shown above

### Google Gemini
**Pros:**
- Latest AI technology (Gemini 3.0 Flash/Pro)
- Fast responses
- Best accuracy for complex tasks and multimodal analysis

**Cons:**
- Requires API key and internet
- Data sent to Google servers
- Usage costs may apply (though free tier is generous)

### Groq
**Pros:**
- Super fast inference
- Free tier available

**Cons:**
- No multimodal (vision) responses via Groq directly in this implementation context (usually text-only)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Closing the App**: 
   - Press `Cmd + Q` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Q` (Windows/Linux) to quit
   - Or use Activity Monitor/Task Manager to close `Natively`
   - The X button currently doesn't work (known issue)

2. **If the app doesn't start**:
   - Make sure no other app is using port 5180
   - Try killing existing processes:
     ```bash
     # Find processes using port 5180
     lsof -i :5180
     # Kill them (replace [PID] with the process ID)
     kill [PID]
     ```
   - For Ollama users: Make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + B`: Toggle window visibility
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + H`: Take screenshot (Smart Analysis)
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + H`: Take selective screenshot
   - `Cmd + Enter`: Get solution / Send message
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow Keys`: Move window

#### General Installation Issues
If you see other errors:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json` 
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Try running with `npm start`
