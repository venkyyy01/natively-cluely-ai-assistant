    # Changelog

    ## [2.0.5] - 2026-03-15

    ### Improvements

    - **Stealth Mode UI**: The Process Disguise selector is now visually disabled and locked while Undetectable mode is active, preventing accidental state mismatches.
    - **State Synchronization**: Greatly improved internal state synchronization across all application windows (Settings, Launcher, Overlay).

    ### Fixes

    - **Infinite Feedback Loops**: Completely eliminated the bug where toggling Undetectable mode would sometimes cause the app to rapidly toggle itself on and off.
    - **Delayed Dock Reappearance**: Fixed a regression where the macOS dock icon would mysteriously reappear several seconds after entering stealth mode if a disguise had recently been changed.
    - **Initial State Loading**: Fixed an issue where the Settings UI would briefly show incorrect toggle states when first opened.
    - **macOS OS-level Events**: Hardened the app against macOS `activate` events (like clicking the app in Finder) accidentally breaking stealth mode.

    ### Technical

    - Refactored IPC (Inter-Process Communication) listeners for `SettingsPopup` and `SettingsOverlay` to use a strict one-way (receive-only) data binding pattern.
    - Added strict management and cancellation of `forceUpdate` timeouts during stealth mode transitions.
    - Added explicit type safety for the new getters in `electron.d.ts`.

    ## [2.0.4] - 2026-03-14

    ### Summary

    Version 2.0.4 introduces a massive architectural overhaul to the native audio pipeline, guaranteeing production-ready stability, true zero-allocation data transfer, and instantaneous STT responsiveness with WebRTC ML-based VAD.

    ### What's New

    - **Two-Stage Silence Processing**: Replaced basic RMS noise gating with a two-stage pipeline combining an adaptive RMS threshold and WebRTC Machine Learning VAD. Rejects typing, fan noise, and non-speech sounds before they bill STT APIs.
    - **Zero-Copy ABI Transfers**: Transitioned the `ThreadsafeFunction` bridging to direct `napi::Buffer` (Uint8Array) allocations, completely eliminating V8 garbage collection pressure during continuous capture.
    - **Sliding-Window RAG**: Implemented a 50-token semantic overlap in `SemanticChunker.ts` to prevent conversational context loss across chunk boundaries.

    ### Improvements

    - **Latency & Responsiveness Tuning**: Stripped redundant TS debouncing, slashed `MIN_BUFFER_BYTES`, and reduced native hangover, achieving a ~300ms reduction in end-to-end transcription latency. short utterances ("Yes", "Stop") no longer sit trapped in the buffer.
    - Removed floating-point division truncation for superior downsampling from 44.1kHz external microphones.

    ### Fixes

    - Fixed a critical bug where the native Rust monitor returned a hardcoded `16000Hz` while actually streaming 48kHz audio. Now syncs true hardware sample rates.
    - Resolved the "Input missing" silent crash bug on microphone restarts by properly recreating the CPAL stream.
    - Restored the 10s continuous speech backstop for REST APIs to prevent unbounded buffer growth.
    - Added missing `notifySpeechEnded()` properties and cleaned up dangerous type casts.

    ### Technical

    - Audio processing transitioned entirely to strict ABI memory bridging (`napi::Buffer`)
    - Re-architected native silence_suppression state machine around WebRTC VAD inputs.

    ## [2.0.3] - 2026-03-13

    ### What's New

    - **Dynamic AI Model Selection:** Replaced static model lists with dynamic dropdowns. Your preferred models synced from providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) now automatically appear across the entire app.
    - **Multimodal Resilience:** Added a "Smart Dynamic Fallback" using Groq Llama 4 Scout. If default vision models fail or get rate-limited during screen analysis, Natively instantly reroutes the image to ensure uninterrupted performance.
    - **Multiple Screenshot Support:** The Natively Interface can now handle and process multiple attached screenshots simultaneously instead of just one.
    - **Improved Settings UX:** API keys now auto-save after 5 seconds of inactivity, and selecting a preferred model immediately updates the rest of the application without requiring a page reload.

    ### Architecture & Fixes

    - **Better Embeddings:** Migrated from Gemini Embedding to a completely new and more robust embedding architecture.
    - **Claude Fixes:** Resolved max_tokens and context limits issues specific to Anthropic Claude interactions.
    - **DRY Refactoring:** Centralized model configuration strings across the codebase to ensure easier future updates.
